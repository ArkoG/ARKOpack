0-INDEX couleurs
1- "Natt och Dag" # nr 148 swedish
2- "Gøye" # nr 100263 danish
3- "Daa" # nr 100266 danish
4- "av Sudreim" # nr 145 norwegian and 2028 "Sudrheim" Norwegian(in the gameperiod it would have been spelled "Suðrheim") the original coa is the red seven pointed star on gold, but one part of the family(both in Norway) adopted a redrose on gold instead a century later.
5- "Finsta" # nr 100290 swedish
6- "Kane" # nr 2018 norwegian
7- "Kusse" # nr 2020 danish and "Smør" # nr 2046 norwegian # as a bonus info; Smør means butter and Kusse means..... the private parts of a lady.
8- "Kaas" # nr 100276 norwegian. Should be danish culture. There was only two big families(both with a lot of subbranches) called Kaas and they were both Danish(and I haven't read that either of them ever held much land in Norway), the oldest one(the one with this COA) was from Jutland the slightly younger(1397 while the older is from around 1230) was from Fyn.  
9- "Losna" # nr 2021 norwegian
10- "Puke" # nr 100299 swedish
11- "Marsvin" # nr 1023 swedish. Should be danish culture. Marsvin was a danish family from Sjælland, a few of them later settled in sweden and made a branch there, but that was way outside the timeline of the game(around 16-17th century while the family exsisted in Denmark since at least 1310(maybe 1280))
12- "Hatt" # nr 1015 swedish
13- "Juul"nr 1025002 danish
14- "Ulfeldt"nr 1025003 danish
15- "af Aspenäs" # nr 100293 swedish
16- "Glysing"nr 152 danish
17- "Galen"nr 760 danish
18- "Gylta" # nr 100288 swedish
19- "af Hammersta" # nr 100296 swedish
20- "Eka" # nr 1008 swedish
21- "Gren" # nr 100291 swedish
22- "Bielke" # nr 153 swedish and "Bjelke" nr 2038 swedish Im considereing making one of these danish, there was two unrelated families with this name one from Sweden(13th century) and one from Denmark(14th century). The danish one would sport a coa much like "Galen"(both Galen and the danish Bielke were closely tied to the Hvide family. Hence why their coa looked much like the early Hvide. The one attached to Hvide currently(the silver star on blue) is the Hvide branch setup by Marsk(Marshall) Stig's decendends(he wasn't a  Hvide himself but he married a Hvide 3 times, and he was the most powerfull man that sided with the Hvides. They lost their bid for the throne and he escaped to Norway, but when the Hvide family revived their power after the next throne succesion, it was Marsk Stig's kin that were the most influential among the Hvide branches).
23- "Snedbielke" # nr 1049 swedish
24- "Leijonhufvud" # nr 100292 swedish
25- "af Erik" # nr 381 swedish
26- "Bååt" # nr 131 swedish
27- "Bonde" # nr 3811 swedish
28- "Hjerne" # nr 2042 norwegian
29- "Ribbing" # nr 130 swedish. Should be danish.
30- "Tre Rosor" # nr 1037 swedish
31- "Virske" # nr 1044 swedish
32- "Tre Sjöblad" # nr 1144 swedish and 1032 "Sture" swedish. Its basicly the same family(Sture is the most accuarate). I have changed "tre sjöblad" to "Ving" since that actually was another family(still same COA though)
33- "Sjöblad" # nr 144 swedish
34- "af Ulvåsa" # nr 143 swedish
35- "Ulv" # nr 136 swedish
36- "Balk" # nr 101769 norwegian
37- "Bjarkøy" # nr 2005 norwegian
38- "Grip" # nr 121 swedish. RL family usually styled with a black gryffin head on gold, but the whole black gryf on gold is so pretty....
39- "Gryfita" # nr 177 pommeranian(not strictly scandinavian but they were heavily intermarried with the house of Estrid aswell as being later kalmarunion royal family;)) 
40- "Örnsparre" # nr 1048 swedish
41- "af Fånö" # nr 1010 swedish
42- "Banner" # nr 1002 danish
43- "Krabbe" # nr 100269 norwegian. Should be danish,
44- "Ulfstand" # 100305 danish
45- "Rumby" # 763 swedish
46- "Brockenhuus" # nr 100002 norwegian. Should be danish, it was an influencial 14th century family from Fyn, and the Norwegian branch wasn't formed until the 17th century....
47- "Reventlow" # 100302 danish 
48- "Brahe" # nr 140 swedish. **See second note below**
49- "Gera" # nr 100285 swedish 
50- "Banér" # nr 101767 norwegian. It should be swedish.
51- "Skancke" # nr 127 swedish  and "Skanke" # nr 2045 norwegian. Its quite funny, PI decided to give a coa to the dynasty styling the swedish name for the family but not the Norwegian, they wasn't that big in sweden but they were very influencial in Norway and contender to the Norwegian throne....
52- "Rosenkrantz" # nr 100275 norwegian. It should be danish.
53- "Rosenstråle" # nr 100294 swedish("rosebeam" talking of goofy names^^ but it is real)
54- "Gullbjelke" # nr 133 norwegian. Im not totally certain what PI thinks this should be, basicly there were two bielke/bjelke families one in DK(from 15th century) and one in Sweden(from 13th century), the swedish(the one thats number 22) is gold on blue(number of "bilke's" varried) while the danish was two blue and two silver. So this COA is made assuming its a meant as a norwegian subbranch to the swedish family(gull means gold in norwegian).
55- "Sparre" # nr 137 swedish
56- "Svinhufvud" # nr 1034 swedish
57- "Svarte" # nr 126 swedish. I assume this is "Svarteskånning"(14th century Swedish/Norwegian and later also Danish family), and not the decendants of "Halfdan Svarte"(10th century south Norwegian king, and father of the first king to rule a relativly united Norway, he isn't in game and his son has a different dynasty id) only one char id in game and its for a late 13th century norwgian female. SO based on this I have changed the name to "Svarteskånning"
58- "Pik" # nr 1026 swedish. Either a diagonal seashell(the coa of the founding father) or Diagonally cut and with two cleaved lillies, Colors unknow. As Bonus info, it means dick(at least in danish)^^
59- "Ekeblad" # nr 100283 swedish 
60- "Vasa" # nr 1042 swedish
61- "Bolt" # nr 125 norwegian and "Bolt" nr 2039 norwegian
62- "Dosenrode" # nr 473 norwegian. Should be danish. 13th-14th century danish nobility from the possesions in Holstein.
63- "Vingad Pil" # nr 1045 swedish
64- "Vingad Lilja" # nr 1046 swedish.
65- "Galte" # nr 100282 norwegian and "Galtung" nr 2041 norwegian
66- "af Vinstorpa" # nr 1043 swedish
67- "af Estrid" # nr 487 danish
68- "Pagh" # nr 100272 norwegian. Should be danish. It was the most important family on Fyn(12-15th century), holding sway over Odense(third largest city in DK) for centuries, and they had nothing to do with Norway what so ever.
69- "Blixen" # nr 100270 norwegian.
70- "Ryning" # nr 100267 danish. A bit of a complicated one, they originated from Skåne and that would make them danish, and the name also sounds inheritly danish. But they were almost esclusivly allied with swedish monarchs or the swedish uppernobility(under the kalmar union) aginst the danish crown(founding father excluded). Making them Danish like PI has is okay I think, but one could argument for making them swedish.
71- "Lodehat" # nr 100271 norwegian. Should be danish, they had a bishop of Rosklide and one of København(was also Chancellor to Eriki of Pommernia). Basicly it meant "furryhat" or "sillyhat"(just like the viking Regnar "Lodebrogs"(furry pants)), no one knows which colors and the only place the coa is depicted is on one of the bishops tombstone.
72- "Frille" # nr 100280 swedish. Should be danish. Noble 13th century family from southern Jutland.
73- "Kärling" # nr 100289 swedish
74- "Lilliehöök" # nr 100297 swedish
75- "af Malsta" # nr 100298 swedish
76- "Soop" # nr 100286 swedish
77- "Slatte" # nr 100300 swedish
78- "Bildt" # nr 100278 norwegian. A complicated one again, the founding father is supposed to have been a great Norwegian viking(but its likely just a legend to add some glamour to the familytree^^)the family originate from Jutland(known since 11th-12th century)and post 15th century some also moved to Sweden. I think making them danish is the best bet since the Norwegian link likely isn't real and the family should apear in DK and certainly not in Norway..
79- "Thrugot" # nr 1025000 danish. One sketchy one this one, the family had no today known coa. But the founding father(thrugot)'s own father was called "Ulv Galiciefarer""wolf the Galicia venture"(not shure if its supposed to be Spain or France in this situation its likely around the year 1000)."Ulv" means "wolf" and the full name of Thrugot was "Thrugot Ulfsen Fagerskind" in english "Thrugot Wolfson Fairskin"(the last is a nickname he gained)Since its one of the few early families ingame(unlanded in vanilla for some reason, despite Thrugot being Jarl of Upperjutland in RL) I thought it would be nice giving it a COA and then a golden wolf seemed like the best bet. 
80- "Bang" # nr 1025004 danish
81- "Hack" # nr 1025001 danish. Should be "Hak" (wasn't spelled "Hack" until the 16th century). Most places its spelled "Hak" and was 12th century family from Skåne, it seems "Hack" didn't get used by the main danish branch but instead was used later by the swedish(the swedish subbranch is quite a lot younger than the danish and they don't appear to have used "Hack" until before some point in the 16th century). 
82- "Tre Rutor" # nr 1038 swedish
83- "Hästesko" # nr 1047 swedish
84- "Hiort" # nr 100287 swedish. Means"deer" but their coa was a blackhorse head with golden sparre on top, go figure(just as weired there was a danish family called "Heest" ("hest" means horse) that had half a reddeer on silver as coa). Was also a danish family "Hjort" that styled a red deer on silver, and another swedish family "Hjort af Ornäs" that styled two seperate gold antlers on red and a third swedish family called "Hjorthorn"(means deer antler) that styeld two golden joined deer antlers on red.
85- "Oxhufvud" # nr 1024 swedish. Family from Halland(then called "Oxhuvud") later some also settled in Sweden, since its the name of the Swedish branch I have let them stay swedish.
86- "Svan" # nr 1033 swedish
87- "Skytte" # nr 1029 swedish. Should be danish, the family of this coa is from Halland(13th century, somteimes they have also been dpicted with a coa much like lodehat(but where the head is looking towards the left) ) and is also supposed to be related to a "Krugelund" family from Fyn(with same triangular shaped COA), there was also multiple Skytte families(not related) in Sweden but none of them exsisted before 1498 AD, and most is from the 17th century. 
88- "Gedda" # nr 1013 swedish.
89- "Lake" # nr 1020 swedish.
90- "And" # nr 100284 swedish.
91- "Färla" # nr 138 swedish.
92- "Oxpanna" # nr 1025 swedish.Should be "Oxenstierna"(which is the correct name for the family), the Pi name is a simplified swedish version of the name, both means "ox forhead". "stierna" is swedish for star but its supposed to be derived from the german word for forhead(stiern), which then got wrongly written down and ended up as "ox star". Coa is a red oxforhead on gold.
93- "Stake" # nr 1030 swedish.
94- "Stenbock" # nr 1031 swedish.
95- "Läma" # nr 1050 swedish and "Läma" # nr 761 swedish
96- "Hård" # nr 2017 norwegian.
97- "Gjesling" # nr 2027 norwegian.
98- "Darre" # nr 2011 danish
99- "Botner" # nr 2009 danish. Should be norwegian(yes you read right :D ). Norwegian noble family from the time of the dual monarchy.
100- "Bratt".# nr 2010 swedish. Should be to norwegian. Same as above.
101- "Lejonansikte".# nr 1021 swedish. 
102- "Lejonbalk".# nr 1022 swedish.
103- "Kraam".# nr 1019 swedish.  
104- "Get".# nr 1019 swedish.  should be called "ged" and be danish, the family was from Skåne.
105- "Stjerne".# nr 1153 swedish.
106- "Benkestokk".# nr 2001 norwegian.
107- "Aspa".# nr 2003 norwegian.
108- "Giske".# nr 129 norwegian and nr 2034 norwegian. 
109- "Rømer".# nr 2044 norwegian. 
110- "Staur".# nr 2047 norwegian.
111- "Kamp". # nr 2035 and 2043 norwegian.
112- "Galle".# nr 2040 norwegian.
113- "Handingmann".# nr 2002 norwegian.
114- "Egge".# nr 2012 danish. Haven't ever heard about or found any trace of any "Egge" family(was a very small family called "Eggeside" that carried a gold halfvertical branch on red in the left side and red and gold horizontal stripes in right), but there was an "Eeg"(oak) family, so I have changed the name and given the Eeg coa(Oak branch/sprout with three acorns on silver) .
115- "Thornberg". " nr 128 norwegian. If one wanted it authentic contemporary for the period, it should really be spelled "Þornberg"  (when pronunced it sounds exactly like Thornberg) "Þ" in oldnorse equeals "th"(its a soft "h")
116- "Juel".# nr 100277 norwegian.Should be danish(they were from Jutland)
117- "Vedel".# nr 100274 norwegian. "Vedel" was 19th century minor nobility(and only a few members, mostly ladies in waiting to the danish queens) so im assuming they are thinking of "Wedel" an old family with lowsaxon roots originating from the Danish possesions in Holstein(Pinenberg in Wagria to be precise). They were bigtime during the time of the dualmonarchy and still exist in both DK and Norway.
118- "Mule".# nr 471 norwegian.Should be danish or pommern, three families with that name all from DK(one of the families was founded by a hedge knight that from pommern that got naturalised at the danish court). I have attached the coa of the familiy from Fyn(since its the coolest^^) will add the pommerish family under their other name("Falkendal" which was the family seat in DK) in the nonvanilla file. The third family was from Lolland.
119- "Finne" nr 463 norwegian
120- "Fargalt".# nr 1009 swedish.
121- "Forsa".# nr 1011 swedish.
122- "Boberg" nr 1004 and "af Hafrid" # nr 1014 swedish.
123- "Knoppe".# nr 1018 swedish. Should be either "Knob" or "Knope" and be either lowsaxon or danish, the family is from the former danish possesions in holstein, and its named after a manor at the banks of the eider.
124- "Akeleye" # 100001 norwegian, should be danish(the family is from fyn).
125- "af Hafrid" # nr 1014 swedish
126- "af Bese" # nr 1003 swedish
127- "Bagge" # nr 815 swedish. Should be danish(they were from Jutland)
128- "Svärd" # nr 802 swedish(technically lowsaxon, but I don't think they were more than lowgentry until they imigrated to Finland) Colors are not known.
129- "Af Ivar" # nr 20084 danish
130- "Knytling" # nr 490 danish
131- "Djäkn" # nr 801 swedish. Im assuming they are refearing to the family of Sigge "Djäkns", "Djäkns" isn't really a family name but a nickname(and a lot of people had it). Colors of the coa isn't known.
132 - "Grøn" # nr 100264. Just my own take at making the coa(wierdly the wolf actually has to be grey and not silver), I haven't alterd the dynastyfile.
133 - "Hvide" # nr 482. The first known Hvide coa(used by Skjalm Hvides chlidren(coa wasn't in fashion in his own lifetime).
134 - "af Rumby" # nr 142. 
135 - "Porse" # 118. The coa of Porse is three red "Porse"(Myrica) leaves on gold, both Kyrning(three green on silver) and Ribbing nr 29(three gold on blue) is cadet branches of Porse.
136 - "Skarsholm" nr 146 swedish # should be danish ( a cadet branch to estrid), took the name after their family 
137 - "Blå" nr 147 swedish # should be Danish, family was from Jutland.
138 - "Fleming" finnish nr 100588 changed to "Flemming". "Fleming" was a very tiny family in DK(used a bullhead as coa), so im assuming they mean "Flemming", swedish nobility originating from a knight from Flandern. They were big in Finland.
(New ones)
139 - "Yngling" nr 499 Norwegian. Never been fond of the way Paradox used this dynasty for 1066. The 867(Yngling) and 1066(Gille) ruiling familes really shouldn't be the same dynasty(That idea is based on Snorre's saga, but got no basis in RL). In any case the dlc arm looks absolutely horrible and needs to die. Arms used is the one of the Sverre dynasty(same motif as the dlc one) which is a modification of the Gille one(which was just plain lion rampant) which added the axe of Saint Olav(the older brother of Harald Haarderaade the king of Norway in 1066. Also least appropiate person to be named saint ever, was one sadistic fat(was known as "digre" meaning "fat" when he was alive) dude if ever there was one.)
